# Heat_Pump_Furnace_Comparison

Method

compared 95 AFUE natural gas furance (95% efficient) to a 10 HSPF air source heat pump

ducts located in the finished living space were used for both heating systems to eliminate duct heating losses. 

one issue with modeling the heat pump was that the auxiliary electric strip 

used the Building Energy Optimization (BEopt) software, ran simulations for different locations

weather data files - TMY3

used same house for all locations
