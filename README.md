# Heat_Pump_Furnace_Comparison

Introduction

This analysis compares the emissions and operating costs of a typical air source heat pump (ASHP) relative to a high efficient natural gas (NG) furnace. The inspiration to perform this analysis was due in part to the supposed debate regarding the change in CO2 emissions introduced by replacing internal combustion engine vehicles with electric cars. Recent research has clearly shown that electric cars would reduce C02 emissions, regardless of where the car was located in the US. Other motivations for performing this research were to provide an overview of which regions of the US would benefit from replacing NG furnaces with ASHPs on a financial and environmental level, and to determine and quantify the obstacles preventing the electrification of homes in the US. There is little in-depth research comparing NG furnaces and ASHPs, and the goal of this analysis is to ultimately determine the impact of location, climate, electricity mix, and natural gas and electricity prices on the cost and CO2 emissions of replacing NG furnaces with ASHPs.



Method

compared 95 AFUE natural gas furance (95% efficient) to a 10 HSPF air source heat pump

ducts located in the finished living space were used for both heating systems to eliminate duct heating losses. 

one issue with modeling the heat pump was that the auxiliary electric strip 

used the Building Energy Optimization (BEopt) software, ran simulations for different locations

weather data files - TMY3

used same house for all locations
